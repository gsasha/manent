ACT I SCENE IV 	The platform.	 
 	Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS	 
HAMLET 	The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.	 
HORATIO 	It is a nipping and an eager air.	 
HAMLET 	What hour now?	 
HORATIO 	think it lacks of twelve.	 5
HAMLET 	No, it is struck.	 
HORATIO 	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season	 
 	Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.	 
 	A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within	 
 	What does this mean, my lord?	 
HAMLET 	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,	 10
 	Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;	 
 	And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,	 
 	The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out	 
 	The triumph of his pledge.	 
HORATIO 	Is it a custom?	 15
HAMLET 	Ay, marry, is't:	 
 	But to my mind, though I am native here	 
 	And to the manner born, it is a custom	 
 	More honour'd in the breach than the observance.	 
 	This heavy-headed revel east and west	 20
 	Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:	 
 	They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase	 
 	Soil our addition; and indeed it takes	 
 	From our achievements, though perform'd at height,	 
 	The pith and marrow of our attribute.	 25
 	So, oft it chances in particular men,	 
 	That for some vicious mole of nature in them,	 
 	As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,	 
 	Since nature cannot choose his origin--	 
 	By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,	 30
 	Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,	 
 	Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens	 
 	The form of plausive manners, that these men,	 
 	Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,	 
 	Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--	 35
 	Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,	 
 	As infinite as man may undergo--	 
 	Shall in the general censure take corruption	 
 	From that particular fault: the dram of eale	 
 	Doth all the noble substance of a doubt	 40
 	To his own scandal.	 
HORATIO 	Look, my lord, it comes!	 
 	Enter Ghost	 
HAMLET 	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!	 
 	Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,	 
 	Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,	 45
 	Be thy intents wicked or charitable,	 
 	Thou comest in such a questionable shape	 
 	That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,	 
 	King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!	 
 	Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell	 50
 	Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,	 
 	Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,	 
 	Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,	 
 	Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,	 
 	To cast thee up again. What may this mean,	 55
 	That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel	 
 	Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,	 
 	Making night hideous; and we fools of nature	 
 	So horridly to shake our disposition	 
 	With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?	 60
 	Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?	 
 	Ghost beckons HAMLET	 
HORATIO 	It beckons you to go away with it,	 
 	As if it some impartment did desire	 
 	To you alone.	 
MARCELLUS 	Look, with what courteous action	 65
 	It waves you to a more removed ground:	 
 	But do not go with it.	 
HORATIO 	No, by no means.	 
HAMLET 	It will not speak; then I will follow it.	 
HORATIO 	Do not, my lord.	 70
HAMLET 	Why, what should be the fear?	 
 	I do not set my life in a pin's fee;	 
 	And for my soul, what can it do to that,	 
 	Being a thing immortal as itself?	 
 	It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.	 75
HORATIO 	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,	 
 	Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff	 
 	That beetles o'er his base into the sea,	 
 	And there assume some other horrible form,	 
 	Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason	 80
 	And draw you into madness? think of it:	 
 	The very place puts toys of desperation,	 
 	Without more motive, into every brain	 
 	That looks so many fathoms to the sea	 
 	And hears it roar beneath.	 85
HAMLET 	It waves me still.	 
 	Go on; I'll follow thee.	 
MARCELLUS 	You shall not go, my lord.	 
HAMLET 	Hold off your hands.	 
HORATIO 	Be ruled; you shall not go.	 90
HAMLET 	My fate cries out,	 
 	And makes each petty artery in this body	 
 	As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.	 
 	Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.	 
 	By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!	 95
 	I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.	 
 	Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET	 
HORATIO 	He waxes desperate with imagination.	 
MARCELLUS 	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.	 
HORATIO 	Have after. To what issue will this come?	 
MARCELLUS 	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	 100
HORATIO 	Heaven will direct it.	 
MARCELLUS 	Nay, let's follow him.	 
 	Exeunt
