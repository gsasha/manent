This is a preliminary installer for Windows.
It expects that you have installed Manent in the default directory,
"c:\Program Files\Manent", and won't work otherwise.

To run Manent, type "manent" in your cmd.
To run unit tests, type "c:\Program Files\Manent\manent-unittest.exe"
To run integration tests, type "c:\Program
Files\Manent\manent-integration-test.exe"
