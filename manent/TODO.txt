FEATURES PLANNED FOR 1.0

- Implement storage queueing. After that, make sure that if process crashes after uploading container, it still can continue.

- Add options for storage and exclusion reconfiguration

- Make sure several DB's can open in parallel (probably it's the DB_JOINENV flag).

- Implement summary headers

- Make sure data reloads correctly on storage manager load

FEATURES PLANNED FOR 1.1

- Provide a more accurate estimate of progress

- Add executable to create summary headers over existing backup

- Create compiled executables out of the Python source

- Add a filesystem interface for Linux (FUSE)

- Write parsing plugins for MP3, JPG, ZIP, .o, .a, .so

- Consider adding curses-based interface

- Improve "info" command

FEATURES PLANNED FOR 2.0

- Add GUI interface

- Add automatic scheduling interface

------------------------------------
DONE:

- Check that name of backup does not collide with existing files

- Organize file names in ~/.manent

- Add copyright statement in every file

- Check why recreating storage reloads data files, and not only the header files.
  DONE
  - Check that in all the places where load_body is called, which can be abandoned.

- Remove flush method from Node

- Add "info" command

- Make sure that all aside blocks are saved in the end

- Make sure that aside blocks registered in BlockManager are always sent out to a container. Possible solution: have a database of blocks that were put aside. For that, move BlockManager to within StorageManager (which makes sense anyway).

- Write the caching of hash(path)->digest for directories for faster restart of scanning

- Reconstruct the list of increments.

- make sure that container bodies of containers with metadata are read

- Remove the base_fs_digests

- Remove dump_intermediate from IncrementManager

- Add command line parameters to configure exclusion engine

- Add automatic exclusion rules for Linux

- Add reading of exclusion rules from ~/.manent/exclusion_rules
