CHANGELOG:

0.9.7:

- fix permissions for db files

FEATURES PLANNED FOR 0.9.8:

- Implement summary headers.
  First, we'll implement normal summary headers, i.e., created through non-failing execution.
  Then, we'll consider creating summary headers over failed execution.

  Add an executable to recreate summary headers for orphaned sequences.

- Correctly decide which summary headers to load:
  1. If the summary header index is less than the highest loaded header index, ignore it.
  2. If the header contained in a summary is less than the highest loaded, or if it is already loaded, ignore it.

- Perform better decisions on when to store summary headers:
  1. Introduce threshold on the number of headers in summary before they are pushed as a result of increment finalizaiton.
  2. Add summary headers (if asked for...) for foreign sequences.

FEATURES PLANNED FOR 1.0

- Implement system testing.

- Write more metadata to increment, such as backup name, machine name etc.

- add option "compare=" to "Manent.py test"

- Implement storage queueing. After that, make sure that if process crashes after uploading container, it still can continue.

- Add options for storage and exclusion reconfiguration

- Make sure several DB's can open in parallel (probably it's the DB_JOINENV flag).

- Make sure data reloads correctly on storage manager load

FEATURES PLANNED FOR 1.X

- Implement a "diff" command that tells what changed

- Provide a more accurate estimate of progress

- Add executable to create summary headers over existing backup

- Create compiled executables out of the Python source

- Add a filesystem interface for Linux (FUSE)

- Add a filesystem interface as a http or ftp server

- Write parsing plugins for MP3, JPG, ZIP, .o, .a, .so

- Consider adding curses-based interface

- Improve "info" command

- Add capability to backup to Amazon S3

- Add capability to backup to optical media

- Add capability to backup to email

FEATURES PLANNED FOR 2.0

- Add GUI interface

- Add automatic scheduling interface

------------------------------------
CHANGELOG V0.9.7:

- Check that name of backup does not collide with existing files

- Organize file names in ~/.manent

- Add copyright statement in every file

- Check why recreating storage reloads data files, and not only the header files.
  DONE
  - Check that in all the places where load_body is called, which can be abandoned.

- Remove flush method from Node

- Add "info" command

- Make sure that all aside blocks are saved in the end

- Make sure that aside blocks registered in BlockManager are always sent out to a container. Possible solution: have a database of blocks that were put aside. For that, move BlockManager to within StorageManager (which makes sense anyway).

- Write the caching of hash(path)->digest for directories for faster restart of scanning

- Reconstruct the list of increments.

- make sure that container bodies of containers with metadata are read

- Remove the base_fs_digests

- Remove dump_intermediate from IncrementManager

- Add command line parameters to configure exclusion engine

- Add automatic exclusion rules for Linux

- Add reading of exclusion rules from ~/.manent/exclusion_rules
