- Add "info" command

- Reconstruct the list of increments

- make sure that container bodies of containers with metadata are read

- Remove the base_fs_digests

- Remove dump_intermediate from IncrementManager

- Make sure that all aside blocks are saved in the end

- Make sure that aside blocks registered in BlockManager are always sent out to a container. Possible solution: have a database of blocks that were put aside. For that, move BlockManager to within StorageManager (which makes sense anyway).

- Write the caching of hash(path)->digest for directories for faster restart of scanning

- Provide a more accurate estimate of progress

- Write parsing plugins for MP3, JPG, ZIP, .o, .a, .so

- Consider adding curses-based interface

------------------------------------

- Check why recreating storage reloads data files, and not only the header files.
  DONE
  - Check that in all the places where load_body is called, which can be abandoned.

- Remove flush method from Node
