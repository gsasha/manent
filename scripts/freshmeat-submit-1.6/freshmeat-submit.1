.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
freshmeat\-submit is a command\-line tool for submitting release announcements to freshmeat\&.net\&. It is intended for batch\-mode operation in project release scripts, and designed so that its input format can easily be generated by scripts\&.

.PP
freshmeat\-submit accepts release information from binary packages named in the command line, or from an email\-message\-like data block on standard input, or from command\-line flags\&. Values set with command\-line flags override those collected from standard input, which in turn override those collected from binary package files\&. The accumulated data is entered into the freshmeat database via its XML\-RPC interface\&.

.PP
A few flags control the operation of freshmeat\-submit itself\&.

.TP
\-d
Delete the specified release rather than submitting it\&. With this option, all data other than Project, Branch, and Release are ignored\&.

.TP
\-n
Process command\-line options only; don't read data from standard input\&.

.TP
\-N
Display the merged record from binary package arguments, standard input and command\-line options to standard output\&. Don't ship it\&.

.TP
\-V
Enable verbose debugging of the XML\-RPC transaction\&. This option is mainly for developers\&.

.PP
Release information is accepted from three sources in the following order:

.TP 3
1.
Binary package files named on the command line\&. Presently the only supported format is RPM\&. The data from certain RPM tags is mined out of the RPM and merged into the release information\&.
.TP
2.
An RFC\-2822\-format message, strongly resembling an ordinary email message, on standard input\&. The message header fields each specify a particular item of release information; the body (if present) becomes the change announcement text\&.
.TP
3.
Command\-line switches\&.
.LP

.PP
Here is a table of the fields and their corresponding command\-line switches:
Message fieldRPM tagShort switchLong switchExplanationProject:NAME\-p\-\-project
.PP
Name of the project (freshmeat shortname) to operate on\&.
Branch:\-\-b\-\-branch
.PP
Name of project branch to operate on; defaults to &#8220;Default branch&#8221;
Version:VERSION\-v\-\-version
.PP
Version string to be associated with the release\&. Conventionally this will look like n\&.n or n\&.n\&.n, where each n is decimal digits\&.
Changes:CHANGELOGTEXT\-c\-\-changes
.PP
The Changes field\&. Plain text, no more than 600 characters\&. If no Changes field or option is already present, the changes text is taken from the body of the RFC\-822 message on standard input\&.
Release\-Focus:\-\-r\-\-release\-focus
.PP
Purpose of this release\&. See the table of release\-focus types below\&.
Hide:\-\-x\-\-hide
.PP
If this field is present and has the value &#8220;Y&#8221;, this release will not be visible on the project page\&.
License:\-\-l\-\-license
.PP
Specify the license under which the release is issued\&. Note that this is not copied from the RPM License field, because the values don't map\&.
Home\-Page\-URL:URL\-H\-\-home\-page\-url
.PP
Specify the project home page\&.
Gzipped\-Tar\-URL:SOURCE\-G\-\-gzipped\-tar\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where a gzipped tarball of source can be found\&.
Bzipped\-Tar\-URL:SOURCE\-B\-\-bzipped\-tar\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where a bzipped tarball of source can be found\&.
Zipped\-Tar\-URL:\-\-Z\-\-zipped\-tar\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where a zipped tarball of source can be found\&.
Changelog\-URL:\-\-C\-\-changelog\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where the project changelog can be found\&.
RPM\-URL:\-\-R\-\-rpm\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where an installable binary RPM can be found\&.
Debian\-URL:\-\-D\-\-debian\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where an installable Debian package can be found\&.
OSX\-URL:\-\-O\-\-osx\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where an OS/X binary can be found\&.
BSD\-Port\-URL:\-\-P\-\-bsdport\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where a BSD Ports package can be found\&.
Purchase\-URL:\-\-U\-\-purchase\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where the software can be purchased\&.
CVS\-URL:\-\-S\-\-cvs\-url
.PP
Specify the URL of the CVS for this package\&.
Mailing\-List\-URL:\-\-L\-\-mailing\-list\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where you can sign up for project mailing lists\&.
Mirror\-Site\-URL:\-\-M\-\-mirror\-site\-url
.PP
Specify the URL where an official mirror site for the project can be found\&.
Demo\-URL:\-\-Eurl\-demo
.PP
Specify the URL where a demonstration site for the package can be found\&.

.PP
The license and all URL fields, when specified, actually change the branch record for the project\&. Only the Changes, Version, Release\-Focus, and Hide fields are actually stored for each version\&.

.PP
Here are the release\-focus types\&. Either the string or the integer is acceptable\&. Case of the string is significant\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
Here is an example of a release\-information record that could be fed to freshmeat\-submit on standard input:

.nf

Project: doclifter
Version: 1\&.1
Release\-Focus: Major feature enhancements
Hide: N
Home\-Page\-URL: http://www\&.catb\&.org/~esr/doclifter/
Gzipped\-Tar\-URL: http://www\&.catb\&.org/~esr/doclifter/doclifter\-1\&.1\&.tar\&.gz
RPM\-URL: http://www\&.catb\&.org/~esr/doclifter/doclifter\-1\&.1\-1\&.i386\&.rpm

Fixed a bug in conditional evaluation that twadmin(8) tickled\&.  Better
detection of pure inclusions\&. Better blank\-section elimination\&.
Kleene star recognized as \&.\&.\&. synonym in command synopses\&.  Correct
some bugs in semantic\-hint collection\&.  Recognize Qt manual pages and
use their conventions\&.  Better lifting of mandoc\-generated
pages\&. Translate groff\-style \\[\&.\&.\&.] escapes, flag unknown ones\&.  Can
now parse K&R style function prototypes as well as ANSI ones\&. This
version lifts 96% of 9829 manual pages in a full Red Hat 9
installation with Fedora updates to *validated* XML\-DocBook\&.

.fi

.PP
More typically, you will run this program in a directory where you have already made an RPM, giving it the RPM as a file argument\&. In that case, all you will normally need to supply is the Release\-Focus field; the other required fields (including, most notably, the Changes field) will be mined out of the RPM\&.

.SH "FILES"

.TP
\fI~/\&.netrc\fR
freshmeat\-submit expects to find your Freshmeat credentials here\&. The correct form for an entry looks like this:


.IP

machine freshmeat
     login <your_freshmeat_login>
     password <your_freshmeat_password>
For security, make sure your \fI~/\&.netrc\fR file is not world\-readable; we recommend doing \fBchmod 600 ~/\&.netrc\fR\&.

.SH "RETURN VALUES"

.PP
0 on success, 1 on failure\&. In case of failure, any error message passed back by the XML\-RPC interface is issued to standard error\&.

.SH "AUTHORS"

.PP
Eric S\&. Raymond <esr@thyrsus\&.com>\&.
